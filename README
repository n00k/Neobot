This software is provided without warranty of any kind.  It may work or it may cause your computer to catch fire ... try it and see, I suppose.

These scripts are written for zsh - if you don't use zsh, it may or may not work (see above) - I don't plan to port it to other shells or operating systems, and absolutely not Windoze.

You should copy all of the files to the same directory, then edit config.sh - the available settings are documented there.

the following files should be included
config.sh.sample - configuration settings - edit this file then save it as config.sh
functions.sh - common functions shared by all other scripts
login.sh - login to neopets
checklogin.sh - check if you are currently logged in - login if no
dailies.sh - run the scripts that only run once per day that also don't care what time they run
altador.sh - get your free gift from the King - must have completed altador adventure
anchor.sh - protect Krawk island from the squid
coltzan.sh - see if Coltzan's ghost is generous
fish.sh - take your pets fishing
fruit.sh - a little desert slot machine
interest.sh - collect your interest from the bank
inventory.sh - stow everything you are carrying in the SDB
jelly.sh - grab some jelly from the pil
market.sh - get current stock prices - only needed if you plan to keep history on all stocks
obsidian.sh - snag a piece of obsidian from the quarry
omelette.sh - get a slice of the big one
petpetpark.sh - get the daily freebie from the park
portfolio.sh - check current price of stocks you own - sell if price is high
shore.sh - visit the forgotten shore and see what you can get - must have completed the map
snow.sh - visit the Snowagers cave and try to snag something
springs.sh - visit the healing springs
tomb.sh - explore the tomb of Geraptiku
worms.sh - collect the lantern, 10 worms, scrap metal, gears, and moltite

requirements: 
	must have - nothing works without:
	zsh
	wget

	should have - most of the scripts like:
	sed

	probably have - your distribution probably already has:
	sleep
	date 	
	cut
	tr

Running:
	You can execute any of the scripts manually.  If you choose to run the dailies.sh, take a look inside so you know which other scripts it runs.

	The cron entries I use:
